#### Why did you make this app? <img src="repository_assets/gifs/gear.gif" alt="Character Card Builder" height="25" width="25">

To implement what I learnt. I created _CCB_ in **1 week** after I finished learning [PostgreSQL](https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/).  During the process I also learnt [ReduxJS](https://redux.js.org/).

## [Backend](https://cardbuilderv2.herokuapp.com/) <img src="repository_assets/gifs/gears.gif" alt="Character Card Builder" height="35" width="35">

The Backend uses **PostgreSQL** *(no ORM - raw SQL queries)* as the *Database* and **NodeJS** as *runtime* with **Express** framework.

**Code for backend can be found [here on the *backend* branch](https://github.com/uinstinct/card_builder/tree/backend)**

## [Frontend](https://charactercardbuilder.netlify.app/) <img src="repository_assets/gifs/design.gif" alt="Character Card Builder" height="35" width="35">

The frontend is made using **React and Redux**, **Semantic UI** and **Axios** for api calls.

**Code for frontend can be found [here on the _fronted_ branch](https://github.com/uinstinct/card_builder/tree/frontend)**
